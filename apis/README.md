## APIs

#### Application Programming Interfaces

An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects  
that programmers can use to `create software` or `interact with an external system`.

- Endpoint
- Paths
- Parameters
- Authentication

APIs provide multifple formats

- `JSON` : JavaScript object notation
- `XML` : extensible markup language
- `HTML`

JSON is currently the most favoured format. Because it's much lighter weight than the other two,  
Also it's very easy to turn back into a javascript object
