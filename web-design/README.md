- Typography

- User Experience Design

## Colors

### Moods

- `Red`: love, energy, intensity
- `Yellow`: joy, intellect, attention
- `Green`: freshness, safety, growth
- `Blue`: stability, trust, serenity
- `Purple`: royalty, wealth, femininity

### Combination of Colors

- Analogouse Colors
- Complementary Colors (for icons or logos, not for the text)
- Triadic color palette / drawing a perfect square

## Typography

`readability` and `legibility` is important

- use 2 fonts in one design -> looks cleaner and tighter
  - `Similar`: Mood & Time Era
  - `Contrast`: Serif-ness & Weights

## User Interface Design

1. Hierarchy

- Color
- Size

2. Layout

- line length
  - too long: tedious to read
  - too short: feels too choppy, awkward to read
- 40 ~60 characters per line 👍

3. Alignment

4. White Space
   Empty space that's around text or elements

5. Audience

## User Experience Design

1. Simplicity
2. Consistency
3. Reading Patterns -> Use the F-Layout or the Z-Layout
4. All Platform Design
5. Don't use your powers for evil (dark patterns)
